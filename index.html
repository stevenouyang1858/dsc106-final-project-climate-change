    <h1>What are the Implications of Global Warming?</h1>

    <div class = "text-box" id="intro">
        For millions of years, earth’s temperature has warmed and cooled in a cyclic ways driven by natural wonders.

        However, something different happened in the past two centuries. As industrial revolution happened around the world, 
        humans began releasing an unprecedented amount of CO2, a type of greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere from factories, 
        cars, and the burning of coal, oil, and gas. The scatter plot below proved this trend.

    <div class="text-box" id="scatterplot-description">
        This scatter plot plots the change in the average of bi-annual atmospheric CO2 mass in 10 trillion kilograms compared to the average CO2 mass between the years 1950 to 1980. From the plot, there is a strong correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2 mass, meaning that the more greenhouse gas emitted from human activity, the hotter planet Earth gets.

            <section data-step="1">
                <p>If we continue the trend of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, it is estimated that CO2 levels will peak around the year 2100. 
                    This assumes that some climate protections are taken and emissions are stabilized at an intermediate level.</p>

                <p>If minimal to no climate actions are taken, the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere will fall within the range of the red and yellow lines.</p>

    <div class="text-box">
    Changes in temperature happen slowly, so slowly that generations can pass without a noticeable difference in their lifetime. But as of recently, we can see that the change in temperature has sped up, and the effects aren’t as subtle. <br><br>
    The stripes below capture one way that the earth has changed in temperature, especially recently. Each stripe represents a year in time, starting from the mid-1900s and moving forward towards the present. At first, the colors are pale and blue, but as years get closer to the present, the colors darken, the blues disappear and are replaced with dark and ominous reds, showing how the world has heated up, not noticeable year to year, but noticeable decade to decade. <br><br>
    By clicking on a stripe, we can see the world's warming distributed around the world, and by clicking on the map itself, we can zoom into individual countries, even the smaller ones harder to spot. Viewed together, the stripes and map reveal a clear trend: the world is warming and climate change is happening

        <p>
            While global warming affects the entire planet, its impacts are not uniform. Some regions experience 
            warming faster than others due to various factors including geography, ocean currents, and local climate patterns. 
            Select different countries below to see how their temperature anomalies have changed over time. Notice how 
            some countries show more dramatic warming trends, while others may have more moderate changes.

        <h2>The Melting Ice Caps: A Visible Consequence of Warming</h2>
        <p>
            Rising temperatures don't just mean hotter days—they have profound consequences for our planet's ice. 
            This visualization shows how polar sea ice concentration has changed over time. Sea ice acts as a critical 
            component of Earth's climate system, reflecting sunlight and helping regulate global temperatures. As 
            warming continues, we see a dramatic decline in sea ice coverage. The blue line shows historical data, 
            while the red dashed line shows projections if we continue with moderate emissions. Hover over the chart 
            to see specific values and notice how ice coverage has dropped from over 40% in the 1950s to less than 
            30% projected by 2100. This melting ice contributes to sea level rise and further accelerates warming 
            through reduced reflectivity—a dangerous feedback loop.

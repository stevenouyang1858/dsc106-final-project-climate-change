        <h2>Not All Regions Warm Equally</h2>
        <p>
            While global warming affects the entire planet, its impacts are not uniform. Some regions experience 
            warming faster than others due to various factors including geography, ocean currents, and local climate patterns. 
            Select different countries below to see how their temperature anomalies have changed over time. Notice how 
            some countries show more dramatic warming trends, while others may have more moderate changes.

        <h2>The Melting Ice Caps: A Visible Consequence of Warming</h2>
        <p>
            Rising temperatures don't just mean hotter days—they have profound consequences for our planet's ice. 
            This visualization shows how polar sea ice concentration has changed over time. Sea ice acts as a critical 
            component of Earth's climate system, reflecting sunlight and helping regulate global temperatures. As 
            warming continues, we see a dramatic decline in sea ice coverage. The blue line shows historical data, 
            while the red dashed line shows projections if we continue with moderate emissions. Hover over the chart 
            to see specific values and notice how ice coverage has dropped from over 40% in the 1950s to less than 
            30% projected by 2100. This melting ice contributes to sea level rise and further accelerates warming 
            through reduced reflectivity—a dangerous feedback loop.

    <h3>Prototype Write-up</h3>
    <p>
    So far, we have built the overall structure of our webpage on GitHub and have begun cleaning data and preprocessing the data we will use for our visualizations. We planned out the entire narrative of the project following the “and, but, therefore” structure, as well as planning out what type of graphs we want to use for each section of the project, and planning out the layout and purpose of each visualization that we are going to use. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We implemented two different working, but not perfect yet, visualizations in D3 on our page so far. For our first visualization, we wanted to show the correlation between the mass of CO2 in our atmosphere and land surface temperature. Using a scatterplot, we plotted the data points and included a hover interaction that shows the year of each data point.

    For our second visualization, we wanted to show both historical data and future projections of CO2 mass in the atmosphere. Using a line graph, we displayed the historical data and four different SSP projections ranging from low emissions to high emissions on the same graph. We included a feature to allow users to select and deselect different SSP projections to directly compare the projections to historical data and other projection data, as well as a brushing interaction that lets users see different ranges of years and compare projections across a smaller range of years.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most challenging part of our project that we have yet to do is our map plot. We plan on doing a map plot or time-lapse animation on the land surface temperature so that people can visualize specific regions of the world and the temperature progression through years. Implementing either of these will be harder than a line or scatter plot, as we have to overlay it on a map and also plan on adding a slider to scroll through different years. Also we want to make sure that the interactive part is simple as too many colors and places to click and other interactive features might overwhelm the user. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing that might be challenging is implementing what type of slideshow we want our project to be. We are still deciding on a “click to move on” type of slideshow or a continuous scrolling slideshow, and either of those will be hard to implement, as both of them will have to be precise with the transitions to make sure that the user can follow along with the points we are trying to make. \
